# Job Offer Project Using Android Studio and Firebase
Mobile application for job offers, developed using Android Studio and Firebase, featuring two distinct components: the company section and the job seeker section. In the job seeker part, users can upload their details and CV in PDF format, apply for jobs, while the company section allows the addition of job listings with geolocation. Companies can access job seeker details, including their CV, and make decisions to accept or reject applications.
